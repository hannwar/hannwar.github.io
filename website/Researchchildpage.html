          <h3>Effects of Public-School vs Homeschool - Pros and Cons for Each</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;Homeschooling is when parents or caregivers opt to teach their children at home. People choose to teach their children themselves for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes the reasons are religious based. For other parents, they might not want their kids to be subjected to the negative pressures and influences of their peers. These parents almost use homeschooling as a type of protection from the outside world. Other reasons include, but are not limited to, social problems at school, frequent moving, military families, etc. There are a lot of benefits associated with raising kids in a homeschool environment. Research shows the effects to be mostly positive, though I personally have experienced some negative side effects as well. Although public school has been the preferred method of schooling children for decades, it arguably hasn’t always been the most effective method for raising intelligent young adults with strong critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nor is the public school system perfectly suited for every individual person’s learning style. This table reports the percentages of different races that make up the US homeschool and public schooled population.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;Positive Effects of Homeschooling</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Research shows that there are many positive effects of homeschooling. Over the course of multiple studies, homeschooled children do better on academic testing on average than their public-schooled peers. They also perform better on standardized college testing. Most of these students learn from material that is reading heavy, which contributes to a very high reading average percentile in comparison to kids schooled with other methods. Children educated at home also tend to have more grounded identities, better self-esteem, and more self-efficacy. These children don’t have to face as many negative influences from their friends to fit in or feel pressure to commit risky behaviors. Being at home causes a child to develop stronger critical thinking skills, as they are typically given more individual attention and intellectually challenged more than their public-school counterparts. It fosters independence, as homeschooled children must take more responsibility for their own education.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Homeschooled Children Academia Stats vs Public-Schooled Children</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&nbsp; homeschooled children usually score 15 to 30 percentile points above public-school students on standardized tests</li>
          <li>&nbsp; homeschooled children performed better on the SAT and got 80.5 more points on average than public schooled children</li>
          <li>&nbsp; The average for all students taking the ACT is around 21 points. However, the average for homeschooling students is generally between 22 and 23 points</li>
          <li>&nbsp; The same study indicates that 69% of homeschooled students succeed in college and adulthood Cons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;– Negative Effects of Homeschooling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are a lot of negative ideas and concerns surrounding homeschooling and the social effects it can have on children. Homeschooled children are generally thought to be weird, socially awkward, and timid. Research shows that this typically isn’t the case, however. Many adults who were homeschooled in childhood have flourishing social connections and strong ties with others. Oftentimes, parents opt to place their children in extracurricular activities, sports, and other events so their children receive that exposure to different social environments. The concept of “isolated schooling” in which children receive little to no social stimulation is not commonplace although such environments do occur. When they do, these children can have issues adjusting to different social environments, but these usually aren’t overly challenging. In these situations, a lack of consistent socialization with their peers is a possible negative result of homeschooling.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pros – Positive Effects of Public School&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children schooled publicly have access to sports, extracurriculars, and clubs. This also includes art and music programs. These activities are often not available for homeschoolers the same way they would be accessible for other students. Teachers also typically have more qualifications, and depending on the school, students experience more diversity with their peers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cons – Negative Effects of Public School</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Public school is the majority choice for many parents across the US, mostly due to its convenience and affordability. But what kinds of effects is public school having on children? I would assume most people don’t give a lot of thought to it, as many parents wouldn’t have the luxury of schooling their children at home even if they wanted to. There are several negative effects contributed from public schooling that can cause an adolescent difficulty navigating their emotional and intellectual growth. After being at school for eight hours of the day, assuming the child does not participate in extracurricular or sports, they are still given a full workload of homework each week. This does not leave much time for essential family time and hobbies. In those eight hours there is also ample downtime where the child could be learning or spending time at home with their family. Many public schooled children are complacent and under stimulated. This often gets them into trouble, when otherwise they’d be well-behaved children. Teachers are often stressed with the workload of managing anywhere from 10-40 children at once. This frustration often gets taken out on students, causing a stressful environment in which these children are required to learn in. This can have negative effects on not only a student’s emotional well-being, but their academic achievement as well.</p>
