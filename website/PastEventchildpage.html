      <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>When I was younger, my family and I took annual vacations to Puerta Vallarta, Mexico, for several years. One of those years, in 2006 specifically, an event happened that I will never forget. As a child, I had an innate affinity for animals big and small. Everything from insects to birds to mammals, I enjoyed reading books about them all with a small exception for spiders. I never particularly liked those and probably never will. This knowledge potentially ended up saving my life. It was a Sunday morning and my mom was bathing me in preparation for a church service.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We were on the sixth floor of the condo we were staying at, and I remember six-year-old me splashing in the water after my mother left the room. Suddenly, I noticed an odd object floating in the water in front of me. It was small, about the size of my tiny hand, and a brownish-black color. Nearly immediately, I knew that the object in front of me was a very dangerous animal. I didn’t know what kind of creature it was at the time. I just knew I had seen it in books as a venomous animal and that it could cause some serious harm. I shrieked loudly, aware of the danger I was in. My mother came rushing in and quickly surveyed the situation. She yelled out for my dad, who was in the other room as she didn’t know what to do. He rushed in and acted purely on instinct. Instead of removing me from the tub, he chose to grab the scorpion by the tail and flung it out the open window to the ground six stories down. I was okay, but unfortunately in the hectic process my dad had gotten stung. “I could feel the pain traveling from my finger up through my arm to my shoulder,” my dad recalled.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>My mom grabbed the phone and dialed the closest hospital. After finding someone who could fluently speak English, the doctor directed my dad to eat raw garlic. He insisted it would stop the effects of the poison. My mom just so happened to have a garlic clove in the fridge. My dad ate the entire garlic clove raw, and the pain ended up stopping at his shoulder. Had the venom reached his heart, he might not have made it. Funny enough, we still ended up attending that church service.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;There was no AC, and about thirty people were packed somewhat tightly in this 90 degree room. Due to the heat, my dad was quite literally sweating garlic. The intense odor of garlic permeated the room so intensely, I remember smelling it for hours afterwards. To this day, I am very sensitive to garlic and don’t like it in most foods. </p>
